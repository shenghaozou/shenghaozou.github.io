鉴于国内信息鱼龙混杂，病人情绪低落。每次收到社区中一封喜讯的时候，我希望借此机会发布于此，给更多的患者的希望。

莉莉安：

I want to share my personal story about the effectiveness of Gleevec preventing recurrence.

I had a large, gastric Gist tumor resected, high mitotic rate, no prior Gleevec, in 2006. I started 400mg Gleevec after surgery, but had to discontinue Gleevec eight months later due to liver toxicity. After nine moths without Gleevec Gist recurred on the peritoneum and was completely resected. I have been on Gleevec ever since and am still NED. I have got four grandchildren since 2006 and am grateful for the chance to see them grow. Dr. Heinrich recommended Gleevec until it stops working. That has not happened yet. Next scan in January....

九年，服用格列卫，第八个月由于肝毒性暂停格一段时间，后来出现复发情况，继续服用，目前9年了没有复发状况，格列卫仍然在起效。
